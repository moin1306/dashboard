# Financial Consumer Complaints Data Analysis Using Tableau Dashboard



## PROJECT NAME:

Complaints to Clarity: Tableau Financial Dashboard - - A Complete KPI Analysis Project

## ABOUT PROJECT:

This project is a Tableau dashboard that tracks financial complaints and shows trends across different categories. It’s a ready-to-use tool for businesses, helping employees make smart decisions by looking at key performance indicators (KPIs). I got the idea for this dashboard from Gandes Goldestan. It’s dynamic—users can pick a date range at the top right and watch the maps and charts update with cool visuals!



###  1. Purpose: This dashboard analyzes financial consumer complaints to uncover why customers are unhappy and suggest fixes, using an interactive Tableau tool that updates with fresh data.

   
### 2. End Result: We want an automated dashboard that quickly tracks all complaints, shows trends, and helps people make smart decisions based on the data.
  
  
## DASHBOARD CONTENT:

   1. Total Number of complaints filed.

   2. Timely response to those complaints.

   3. No. of issues resolved at no cost.

   4. Breakdown of complaints by issue category.

   5. Complaints submitted by different States.

   6. Complaints by Media.

   7. Complaints categorized by product type.

   8. Percentage of complaints involving customer disputes.

### OVERVIEW OF VISUALIZATION:

   1) Key performance indicators (KPIs) are positioned at the top of the dashboard for quick access to important metrics like Total Complaints, Timely Responses, Ongoing Complaints, Dispute Rate, and No-Cost Resolutions.

   2) A ‘Donut’ Chart is used to show the percentage of disputed customers

   3) Complaints are categorized based on Issue Type, State, Submission Channel, and Product Category. A hexagonal tile map is utilized for displaying state-wise data, while a lollipop chart illustrates complaints by submission medium.

   4) The idea for the hex tile maps was inspired by the blog series "Sir Viz-a-lot" by Matt Chambers, MBA.

## Insight Gained:

  

    • Total Complaints: 75,513 complaints were recorded.
